Develop a small application for leaving notes. 

It should be possible to :

#1. add, edit and delete notes via buttons in a web page. 
#2. A note has a title and body. 
#3. Default view is a list of notes, descending by entry date. 
#4. Each note�s header should have its title and a date of entry.
#5. The design is not very important, but 

Suggested stack: Spring Boot, AngularJS, 
some in-memory database (or whatever makes the most sense to you) where the notes are saved, 
and any other frameworks you deem necessary.

#6. Please make the code available in any public Git repository of your choice (e.g. Github). 
#7. If you have a possibility to have a running server with a demo of your app, that�s a bonus, but not a neccesity.
#8. document how to deploy your application

VALUES (1, 'Test_Title_1', 'Test_Body', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
INSERT INTO NOTES (NOTE_ID, TITLE, BODY, ENTRY_DATE)
VALUES (2, 'Test_Title_2', 'Test_Body', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
INSERT INTO NOTES (NOTE_ID, TITLE, BODY, ENTRY_DATE)
VALUES (3, 'Test_Title_3', 'Test_Body', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
INSERT INTO NOTES (NOTE_ID, TITLE, BODY, ENTRY_DATE)
VALUES (4, 'Test_Title_4', 'Test_Body', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
